## Multi-Head Neural Network for Emotion Classification and Trigger Detection in Multi-Speaker Dialogues
Authors: Lorenzo Balzani, Alessia Deana, Thomas Guizzetti

### Abstract
In this project, we tackle the Emotion Discovery and Reasoning its Flip in Conversation (EDiReF) task, which focuses on predicting the emotion of each sentence in a dialogue and identifying any emotional shifts of speakers, or "triggers". Our methodology began with creating a BERT-based multi-head neural network, which we then aimed to refine by incorporating a concatenation method, a transformer, and a large language model. 
The outcomes demonstrated strong capabilities in emotion prediction, yet the performance in identifying emotional triggers was less satisfactory. Through our efforts to enhance the model with various improvements, we observed a marginal but significant improvement in the large language model's ability to detect triggers. Still, more fine-tuning is required to reliably recognize emotional changes within dialogues.
